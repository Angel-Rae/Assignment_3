            For this website I was feeling a lot more confident.<br /> I really wanted to try and make it a lot more visually appealing compared to the last website I created, as it was more visually dry.<br />
            I experimented with the colour scheme a lot more this time around. <br/> As I decided to make this website about artist Franck Goheir, who was one of the artists feautured in the Canberra Art Bennial. <br />
            I wanted the website to be modern but visually appealing to somewhat match his vibrant work.
        </p>

        <p id="aboutparagraph">
            I added a subtle gradient background and used light orange and purple text to contrast the blue used in the gradient background.<br />  I found this was more fitting as Franck uses a lot of similar colours in his artworks. <br />
            I'm happy with how i have designed the CAB page, I like how the vibrant artworks look with the background and text, <br/> as well as the image grid and hover details I included over the artwork. <br />
            I found when doing the code for elements such as the navigation and the photo grid, it was more easier this time around and less time consuming, <br/> I understood what I was doing and why I was doing it a lot more. <br />
            I do wish I explored more creative elements with how the layout the paragraphs, but I also didn't want to make the page too overwhelming. <br/> I am really happy with how the index page turned out, the blob animations were kind of a last thought as the page looked too bland. <br />
            I found a tutorial on how to create the shapes and animation all in css, and spent a while exploring those elements and adjusting to create <br/> something that really fits the aesthetic and was the missing piece in which the page needed. <br />
            I fixed up a lot of the mistakes in which I had initially made in the first assingment, such as: <br />
        </p>

        <p id="aboutparagraph">
            putting all the css into one stylesheet rather than having multiple.
        </p>

        <p id="aboutparagraph">
            prioritising making the website responsive from the beginning rather than leaving it for later.
        </p>

        <p id="aboutparagraph">
            and a lot of the mistake I made with brackets facing the wrong direction.
        </p>

        <p id="aboutparagraph">
            Kept my code clean and neat, so it is a lot easier to follow and understand for myself and those who read it. This may have left my code a bit bland, but this has made it significantly easier for me understand and follow.
        </p>

        <p id="aboutparagraph">
            After installing and running Node.js and eleventy, I noticed in my css some of the properties I had included had warnings in which they weren't css property names. Which has confused me as I've leearnt about these elements in the W3 schools css section. <br/>
            I do think this website looks and functions a lot better compared to my first attempt in Assignment 1, but I do think I can improve in the the visual design elements as I got lost on what else I could include to improve the overall look 
            and not leaving it too simple. 
            I would have liked to be a lot more confident to attempt using javascript, but I didn't think my abilities were strong enough at this point in time. 
            But I would like to learn more in the future. 
            Overall I am really happy with what I have done and learnt with doing this site, I think I have most of the basic elements necessary and managed to put in some extras which I am proud of, though I do have a lot to improve on.
