### Reflection

For this website I was feeling a lot more confident. I really wanted to try and make it a lot more visually appealing compared to the last website I created, as it was more visually dry.
I experimented with the colour scheme a lot more this time around. As I decided to make this website about artist Franck Goheir, who was one of the artists feautured in the Canberra Art Bennial.
I wanted the website to be modern but visually appealing to somewhat match his vibrant work. 
I added a subtle gradient background and used light orange and purple text to contrast the blue used in the gradient background. I found this was more fitting as Franck uses a lot of similar colours in his artworks. 
I'm happy with how i have designed the CAB page, I like how the vibrant artworks look with the background and text, as well as the image grid and hover details I included over the artwork. 
I found when doing the code for elements such as the navigation and the photo grid, it was more easier this time around and less time consuming, I understood what I was doing and why I was doing it a lot more.
I do wish I explored more creative elements with how the layout the paragraphs, but I also didn't want to make the page too overwhelming. I am really happy with how the index page turned out, the blob animations were kind of a last thought as the page looked too bland.
I found a tutorial on how to create the shapes and animation all in css, and spent a while exploring those elements and adjusting to create something that really fits the aesthetic and was the missing piece in which the page needed.
I fixed up a lot of the mistakes in which I had initially made in the first assingment, such as:
- putting all the css into one stylesheet rather than having multiple.
- prioritising making the website responsive from the beginning rather than leaving it for later.
- and a lot of the mistake I made with brackets facing the wrong direction.
- Kept my code clean and neat, so it is a lot easier to follow and understand for myself and those who read it. This may have left my code a bit bland, but this has made it significantly easier for me understand and follow.


After installing and running Node.js and eleventy, I noticed in my css some of the properties I had included had warnings in which they weren't css property names. Which has confused me as I've leearnt about these elements in the W3 schools css section.
I do think this website looks and functions a lot better compared to my first attempt in Assignment 1, but I do think I can improve in the the visual design elements as I got lost on what else I could include to improve the overall look
and not leaving it too simple.
I would have liked to be a lot more confident to attempt using javascript, but I didn't think my abilities were strong enough at this point in time. 
But I would like to learn more in the future.
Overall I am really happy with what I have done and learnt with doing this site, I think I have most of the basic elements necessary and managed to put in some extras which I am proud of, though I do have a lot to improve on.
